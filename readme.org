* Snikt!

In the unlikely event that a person interested in reading comic books is also interested in using elaborate systems of
storing information, then this could be useful.

It scrapes a user's [[https://www.comixology.eu/][Comixology]] library and builds a
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/recutils/][recfile]] description of the comics.

** How to use

- Login in to Comixology and open your [[https://www.comixology.eu/my-books/library/_/btitleASC/1][library]].
- Inspect the HTML of each page of the library and download it (maybe I'll automate this in the future, but it's just
two pages for me, so it's not worth the effort right now).
- Run the script: /pipenv run python snikt.py library_1.html library_2.html .../

(This ain't done yet.)
